      <p>Everybody loves halloween, why only do it once per year.</p>
      <p>
        Jack and I wanted to host a small halloween themed gathering at our
        place to celebrate half-halloween
      </p>
      <p>
        our place is at 123 Melrose Street Apartment 957, Bushwick
        Brooklyn.
      </p>
      <p>
        The door people usually buzz people in, but if they don't, buzz
        apartment 957 and we will let you up. Take a right after you go in, take
        the elevator to floor 9, and take a left down the hallway all the way down to our
        unit.
      </p>
      <p>We will have some drinks and some food, but if you want something specific feel free to byo.</p>
      <p>costumes are optional</p>
      <p>at around 11 we are planning to bounce and head to mad tropical, farewell, or one of the many other bushwick bars at our disposal </p>
      
      <p>we hope you'll be able to join us.</p>
